Developed a steganography application in C to encode and decode secret data within image files using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. The project featured user-friendly interfaces for embedding and extracting hidden messages while preserving image integrity. Emphasized efficiency, precision, and secure data concealment for practical applications in data security.
